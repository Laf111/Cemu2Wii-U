> SyncSaves_Cemu-WiiU : automated FTP interface to sync saves between WiiU and CEMU
======================================================================================================

03/03/2021 V1 : (fork of the code of BatchFw V22-3)
    > Use the scripts of BatchFw and remove all the dependencies to the project.
    > 4 entry points 
	- changeAccount.bat : change the account (800000X) used
        - getOnlineFiles.bat : get and save under .\WiiuFiles\OnlineFiles online files needed for CEMU for all users found
          (except opt.bin and seeprom.bin that you need to dump manually from the Wii-U using NANDDUMPER)
        - importWiiuSaves.bat : get saves from the Wii-U for games that exist in MLC_FOLDER and on the Wii-U
          Backup existing save then replace files
        - exportSavesToWiiu.bat : inject saves to the Wii-U for games that exist in MLC_FOLDER and on the Wii-U
          Backup existing save then replace files      
      Remove the first column in the files created by scanWiiU.bat (game's title in BatchFw)
      
      In import/export scripts : 
        - remove the playing time support (for now CEMU does not use saveinfo.xml to save this information)
        - remove wiiuSaveMode = BOTH case, choices left to define Wii-U accounts to treat : "all", "select"
        - Get game's title from the <longname_en> node in meta/meta.xml (to remove Batch Wii-U title database dependency)
      
      
TODO:       
    > save the last configuration in ./lastConfiguration.txt (MLC_FOLDER path for now)
    > shortcuts creation for the 4 main scrits in a install.bat
